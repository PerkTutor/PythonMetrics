PythonMetrics
=============

This repository contains Python scripts to be used as metrics for the PerkTutor.

If you create a Python metric for the PerkTutor, please add it to the "master" branch of this repository to share with other users.

"Core" metrics for the PerkTutor are taken from the "Core" branch of the repository. When updating "Core" metrics, the Qt resource file MUST be manually updated also. To add a "Core" metric, add the Python script into the "Core" branch of this repository AND add that script to the Qt resource file. To remove a "Core" metric, remove the Python script from the "Core" branch of this repository AND remove that script from the Qt resource file.
